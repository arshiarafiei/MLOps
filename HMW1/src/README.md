# Linear Regression HW1

## Descrption

This project implements linear regression models to predict the target variable `y` using features from the provided dataset. The most recent model utilizes two features, `x1` and `x2`, and demonstrates improved performance compared to the previous model, which used only `x1`. By comparing the Mean Squared Error (MSE) of both models, it is evident that including an additional feature (`x2`) leads to more accurate predictions. 

## Run Models

You can run models both using the note book and the the coomand bellow
```
python3 main.py
```
